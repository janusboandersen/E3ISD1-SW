# E3ISD1-SW
The repo contains various code and experiments for the Software stream of E3ISD1 at AU Engineering.

## Purpose
This course focuses on C++ development in embedded Linux systems, using among other the BeagleBone Pocket. No particular dialect is chosen, but I aim at modern C++, so using facilities from C++11/14/17.

## Build System and IDE
No particular build system or IDE is required; I will use CMake and CLion.

## Testing
The repo should use Catch2 for most testing purposes. See e.g.
* [Catch2 Github repo](https://github.com/catchorg/Catch2/)
